This is a private repo, open only to the documentation team currently

The idea is (reasonably simple - when you want something reviewed, make a PR. That gives us a way to track reviews.

The PR can contain:

  - an actual markdown file 
  - a link to something elses (googledocs? a published page? a discourse post)
  
The PR process gives us a way to track when reviews are done etc.

Strecth goals and ideas:

 - make a bot to notify us in the Doc Authors channel when there are reviews waiting
